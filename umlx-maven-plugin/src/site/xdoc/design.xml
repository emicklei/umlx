			<p> The UMLX generator exports Class Diagrams using a simplified layout. Most
				UML tools provide graphical editing features to organize UML elements in a
				diagram. Because the UMLX generator cannot compute such an organization of
				elements, (this is a complete different challenge!) it uses a simple
				table-based layout. For each Java package one diagram is generated. Each
				diagram is composed of UML classes and interfaces and their direct
				relations to other classes and interfaces. For each class, its UML
				representation is shown on the left and all its relations to other elements
				on the right. Relations can be inheritance (super and subclasses),
				interfaces and associations.
